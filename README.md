Accenture Student Challenge: Reinvent Tomorrow with AI
Edition: 8th | Focus: Generative AI for Sustainability in Fashion

Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables and insights for the Accenture Student Challenge. The focus is to design innovative solutions using Generative AI to drive sustainable transformation in the apparel industry, tackling issues like:

Reducing fabric waste.
Promoting eco-friendly materials.
Optimizing resource consumption, including energy and water.
Case Study: ModeX
ModeX is a leading global fashion retailer aiming to:

Minimize fabric waste during design.
Transition to sustainable materials and recycling practices.
Reduce emissions through supply chain optimization.
Proposed Solutions
AI-Based Design Optimization

Use Generative AI to create efficient cutting patterns, minimizing fabric waste without compromising design aesthetics.
Leverage available data: patterns, fabric remnants, historical sales trends.
Supply Chain Optimization

Employ route optimization algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, Deep Learning) to reduce emissions from transportation.
Improve demand forecasting with AI models like SARIMA for seasonality and trend prediction.
Leverage data: transportation costs, emissions, real-time sales.
